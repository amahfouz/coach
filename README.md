```

## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the application: Unit tests and End to End tests.

### Unit Tests

These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine], which is run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. .

To run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.

### End to end testing

These are also written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner.
